# Anokiwave system demo

The purpose of this coden


run with `python3 BeamDemo.py`

## Dependencies
Required the following python3 modules:
 - yaml
 - PyQt5
    - I installed this with pip3 and a downloaded binary. See instructions [here](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html)


Sending out physical commands on the wire through the SPI interposer hardware requires the ni8452's drivers to be installed on your computer and available on your PATH.
That's only been tested on windows.
The beam patterns and GUI should run OK without it though.
